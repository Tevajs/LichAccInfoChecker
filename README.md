# LichessInfoChecker
This program allows you to automatically see information about accounts from a file: Rating, registration date, number of games, title of account.

Work plans:

Finish the program so that it works with my last one: ([link](https://github.com/Tevajs/Lichess-nickname-finder))
*Improve the previous program so that it searches not only for non-existent accounts, but also for those that already exist, just to collect information about them.
*Redo the receipt of information: instead of a file, by connecting it to the nickname-finder program.

Add the ability to display information about badges in the profile: top marathon, top in variants, patron, lichess coach, moderator, verified account, developer, etc.
